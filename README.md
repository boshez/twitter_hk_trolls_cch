# TARGET HK: Chinese State Disinformation Campaigns On Twitter

## By Chua Chin Hon


## SUMMARY
This is a multi-part analysis of China's state disinformation campaign against the Hong Kong protest movement, based on information released by Twitter on Aug 19 and Sept 2o. In its press release, Twitter said the tweets were from "a significant state-backed information operation focused on the situation in Hong Kong, specifically the protest movement and their calls for political change."

This builds on my earlier project on uncovering disinformation campaigns on Twitter: http://bit.ly/StateTrolls
