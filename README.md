# TARGET HK: Chinese State Disinformation Campaigns On Twitter

## By Chua Chin Hon


## SUMMARY
This is a quick dive into the trove of Chinese state troll tweets released by Twitter on Aug 19. In its press release, Twitter said the tweets were from "a significant state-backed information operation focused on the situation in Hong Kong, specifically the protest movement and their calls for political change."

The tweets deserve a deeper examination, and clearly more can be done with the material. I had previously worked on a project on uncovering such disinformation campaigns on Twitter: http://bit.ly/StateTrolls
